  File: Authenticator.mjs

  This module implements authorization. Right now we are exclusively using URLs to access
  restrictred resources. I found this neato page that captures what I want fairly effectively
  https://www.w3.org/TR/capability-urls/

  We are doing what is /not/ recommendedâ€”using the urls as "permanent" secrets for accessing
  resources. As far as I can tell the only insecurity is when a user chooses to share the
  URL. I am not sure of vulnerabilities that could cause a URL to be stolen except by client
  side javascript? Like I am pretty sure (I would HOPE at least!) URLs between tabs are 
  secret from each other. That said this is not a longterm stance, I want to incorporate
  multiple forms and maybe even make these one-use.
  Ah, some insecurities:
   * plugins
   * links to offsite accessed from pages visited via capability url (HTTP "Referer" header)
  
  Well, that's why it's good for one-use situations. get a session cookie and you're good to
  go. My long term posture will likely be use a capability URL to grant one-time access to a
  resource. That could be a long-term session cookie or a password reset page.

  Also in the short term, we are generating access tokens from a capability URL, like a 
  Bearer token for OAUTH except I'm using cookies and not HTTP headers for authorization.

        //  so the client javascript knows the secret. Hmm. Need to think on it more.

        //  think it's okay to keep it.
