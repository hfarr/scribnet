  File: Authenticator.mjs

  This module implements authorization. Right now we are exclusively using URLs to access
  restrictred resources. I found this neato page that captures what I want fairly effectively
  https://www.w3.org/TR/capability-urls/

  We are doing what is /not/ recommendedâ€”using the urls as "permanent" secrets for accessing
  resources. As far as I can tell the only insecurity is when a user chooses to share the
  URL. I am not sure of vulnerabilities that could cause a URL to be stolen except by client
  side javascript? Like I am pretty sure (I would HOPE at least!) URLs between tabs are 
  secret from each other. That said this is not a longterm stance, I want to incorporate
  multiple forms and maybe even make these one-use.
  Ah, some insecurities:
   * plugins
   * links to offsite accessed from pages visited via capability url (HTTP "Referer" header)
  
  Well, that's why it's good for one-use situations. get a session cookie and you're good to
  go. My long term posture will likely be use a capability URL to grant one-time access to a
  resource. That could be a long-term session cookie or a password reset page.

  Also in the short term, we are generating access tokens from a capability URL, like a 
  Bearer token for OAUTH except I'm using cookies and not HTTP headers for authorization.

//  also, we might have different kinds of authorizations, this is authorization of the
//  user. It implicitly authorizes their javascript.
//  My gripe right now is that we don't have a way to configure auth flows, and I think
//  I want some flexibility. For example a JS authorization without reloading a page,
//  so the client javascript knows the secret. Hmm. Need to think on it more.
//  This "low-friction" account style works well for my main access control use case, I
//  think it's okay to keep it.
//  Hmm, does "fetch" automatically use the httpOnly cookies?
//  actually I think fetch might let us do user login without page reloads. Gotta explore.

// TODO okay. With a move to a static "Authenticator" a lot of code doesn't make sense now.
// For example each authenticator instance has its own login token but they all create new
// sessions on a global list of sessions. Not getting closer to my vision on how Auth can be
// hooked up so I'm leaving as is. Presently Authorization is a binary state, you either are
// or are not authorized, without any association to identity. This is sufficient for now.
// N.B  I should sort through the vocabularly between Authorize and Authenticate which are
//      different ideas. 
// Moreover I need to take a good think about what I want this to look like. I like the idea
// of flexibility creating/revoking capability URLs. And I to create a system that supports
// a simple interface for a data & access model. Im not on track for either of those as I'm
// still also concerned with the front end. For now I'm okay with the binary model.
