# {{ title }}

This is a note sample. I'm using a mix of the first few elements I'd like to support,
so I can get a rudimentary design system up.

## Here's a heading. The above is also a heading but it's a titular heading.

This kind of heading is the next step in the organizational hierarchy, anchor tags will
appear to the left for in-note navigation!

I'm thinking I might like to have multiple notes per page, possible. Or maybe entering a
new title will split it into a new note. I'm not sure. I do want some in-note navigation
but I don't know exactly what form it will take.

The mega note appeals, as I like to use three layers of headings or more and I don't like
avoiding titles necessarily, it's conundering. Adapt, evolve â€” do something now, update
it later.

### This is a smaller heading

More details. Maybe I'll add a custom numbering, or an option to export with numbered
headings for like. Making a textbook.

### typically you'll have them adjacent

and that's okay

## and you can kick up to an earlier level
