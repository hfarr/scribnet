    <h1>Title! what in the <em>heck</em> are all these demo pages for?</h1>
    <p>This document exists to easily construct objects for unit testing!</p>
    <p>Featuring a couple of cool paragraphs, <strong>inline elements,</strong> <strong><em>nested</em> line
        elements,</strong> and so much more!</p>
    <p>Well, not "so much" more. Just enough to tell me if there are problems! Like maybe some utf-16 ðŸ˜€ pretty glad
      vscode supports unicode code points...</p>
    <h2>We've got headers too</h2>
    <p>I think this is alright for a <em>standard</em> document experience. Don't you?</p>

<div>
  <p>Deleting across multiple block elements will produce results out of sync with the document. contentEditable will add the remainder of the block element to the right of the selection before delete to the block element left of the selection, after delete.</p>
  <button id="bug">Select here to see</button>
  <p>note the structure of the segments shows, indeed, a p after h2. So, I must ask, why rendering doesn't. Work. hmm</p>
  <p>Another bug- well. Not a bug, just difference in behavior this time. contentEditable is sensitive to where the cursor *was*. That is, if you move the cursor from one text node to the edge, bordering an element with a style such as 'em', the text you enter will be appended to the prior text node. But if you put the cursor at the edge, coming from the right, then the text you enter prepends to the styled node. In mine, the cursor is stateless and doesn't remember where it was, so both situation are the same. It counts as being in the styled node. So, we either have to override that (mmmmm, preventing input events..) or. maybe. Maybe just toggle the editor's "input" status on selection change? We alreaedy have to have state on the editor to indicate if the next entered character should be a different style, this would be no different. </p>
  <p>Then again maybe we double down on behaving as close to content editable as we can. For instance, right now, we don't "squash" adjacent segments in the ListSegment if they have the same tags. That would minimize segments and keep the behavior of list segment closer to editdoc, because it is updating just regular segments. the mutation would produce a new segment inserted into an existing one or elsewise. it would create a NEW segment if the user toggles style mode on the editor. </p>

    /* Two notions for renderes. Independent ones, and ones attached to an editor.
      There can be multiple or 0 independent renderers, and right now we're
      constructing software to allow exactly one renderer, specifically an HTML
      renderer, for the editor component. Eventually such restrictions won't
      apply to that either, where we could have multiple or 0 renderes there too.
      Or maybe for simplicity we won't. Maybe each editor will only have one
      renderer. But Editors can share documents.
      What's the difference then?
      Indepdent renders would use the below to receive all events from the document
    
        htmlRender.setEditDoc(editor.currentDocument)
    
      whereas renders attached to editors won't always re-render. Only when the
      editor decides they should. That's a tricky bit but I think it can still
      work. It's what I'm going to do first, and we'll iterate to uncover the
      next steps, whether either of the proposed ideas above or something else.
