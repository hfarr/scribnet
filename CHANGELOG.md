## Alpha 0.0.0 2022-04-23

First "official" release! Early alpha testing.
Can compile a list of features. At a high level,

* Basic editing
* Content persistence
* Account management (sign up, log in)
  * no "log out" though haha

This is underselling how much it took to get here so I may revisit this with a more detailed list in the future.
